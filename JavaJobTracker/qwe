Line of succession to the British throne

Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714)
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms. The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.[1][2] The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.[3] This article does not attempt to present an exhaustive list, but limits itself to the descendants of the sons of George V. At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all the 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to end male preference primogeniture and the ban on the monarch's marriage to Roman Catholics, and to other changes in the succession rules.[4]
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[5]
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.

Eligibility
The right of succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law,[6] and is limited to the legitimate descendants of legitimate line from the Electress Sophia of Hanover. A person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[n 1][7]
    The succession is ordered by male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture. A person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her line) except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. A person's sons and their lines all come before a person's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.[8]
    At the time of accession, the heir to the throne must be a Protestant and enter into communion with the Church of England.[7]
    Anyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is excluded from the line of succession.[7]
Proposed rule changes
Main article: 2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms
At the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the leaders of the Commonwealth realms agreed to introduce legislation to end male primogeniture of descendants of Charles, Prince of Wales, and to allow heirs to the throne to marry Roman Catholics.[9]

Line of succession to the British throne
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the main explanatory article, see Succession to the British throne.
Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714)
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms. The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.[1][2] The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.[3] This article does not attempt to present an exhaustive list, but limits itself to the descendants of the sons of George V. At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all the 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to end male preference primogeniture and the ban on the monarch's marriage to Roman Catholics, and to other changes in the succession rules.[4]
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[5]
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.

Eligibility
The right of succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law,[6] and is limited to the legitimate descendants of legitimate line from the Electress Sophia of Hanover. A person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[n 1][7]
    The succession is ordered by male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture. A person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her line) except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. A person's sons and their lines all come before a person's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.[8]
    At the time of accession, the heir to the throne must be a Protestant and enter into communion with the Church of England.[7]
    Anyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is excluded from the line of succession.[7]
Proposed rule changes
Main article: 2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms
At the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the leaders of the Commonwealth realms agreed to introduce legislation to end male primogeniture of descendants of Charles, Prince of Wales, and to allow heirs to the throne to marry Roman Catholics.[9]

Line of succession to the British throne
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the main explanatory article, see Succession to the British throne.
Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714)
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms. The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.[1][2] The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.[3] This article does not attempt to present an exhaustive list, but limits itself to the descendants of the sons of George V. At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all the 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to end male preference primogeniture and the ban on the monarch's marriage to Roman Catholics, and to other changes in the succession rules.[4]
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[5]
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.

Eligibility
The right of succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law,[6] and is limited to the legitimate descendants of legitimate line from the Electress Sophia of Hanover. A person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[n 1][7]
    The succession is ordered by male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture. A person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her line) except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. A person's sons and their lines all come before a person's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.[8]
    At the time of accession, the heir to the throne must be a Protestant and enter into communion with the Church of England.[7]
    Anyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is excluded from the line of succession.[7]
Proposed rule changes
Main article: 2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms
At the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the leaders of the Commonwealth realms agreed to introduce legislation to end male primogeniture of descendants of Charles, Prince of Wales, and to allow heirs to the throne to marry Roman Catholics.[9]

Line of succession to the British throne
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the main explanatory article, see Succession to the British throne.
Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714)
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms. The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.[1][2] The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.[3] This article does not attempt to present an exhaustive list, but limits itself to the descendants of the sons of George V. At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all the 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to end male preference primogeniture and the ban on the monarch's marriage to Roman Catholics, and to other changes in the succession rules.[4]
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[5]
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.

Eligibility
The right of succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law,[6] and is limited to the legitimate descendants of legitimate line from the Electress Sophia of Hanover. A person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[n 1][7]
    The succession is ordered by male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture. A person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her line) except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. A person's sons and their lines all come before a person's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.[8]
    At the time of accession, the heir to the throne must be a Protestant and enter into communion with the Church of England.[7]
    Anyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is excluded from the line of succession.[7]
Proposed rule changes
Main article: 2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms
At the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the leaders of the Commonwealth realms agreed to introduce legislation to end male primogeniture of descendants of Charles, Prince of Wales, and to allow heirs to the throne to marry Roman Catholics.[9]

The right of succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law,[6] and is limited to the legitimate descendants of legitimate line from the Electress Sophia of Hanover. A person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[n 1][7]
    The succession is ordered by male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture. A person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her line) except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. A person's sons and their lines all come before a person's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.[8]
    At the time of accession, the heir to the throne must be a Protestant and enter into communion with the Church of England.[7]
    Anyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is excluded from the line of succession.[7]
Proposed rule changes

At the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the leaders of the Commonwealth realms agreed to introduce legislation to end male primogeniture of descendants of Charles, Prince of Wales, and to allow heirs to the throne to marry Roman Catholics.[9]

Line of succession to the British throne
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the main explanatory article, see Succession to the British throne.
Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714)
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms. The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.[1][2] The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.[3] This article does not attempt to present an exhaustive list, but limits itself to the descendants of the sons of George V. At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all the 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to end male preference primogeniture and the ban on the monarch's marriage to Roman Catholics, and to other changes in the succession rules.[4]
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[5]
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.

Line of succession to the British throne
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

For the main explanatory article, see Succession to the British throne.
Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714)
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms. The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.[1][2] The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.[3] This article does not attempt to present an exhaustive list, but limits itself to the descendants of the sons of George V. At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all the 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to end male preference primogeniture and the ban on the monarch's marriage to Roman Catholics, and to other changes in the succession rules.[4]
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[5]
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.

Eligibility
The right of succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law,[6] and is limited to the legitimate descendants of legitimate line from the Electress Sophia of Hanover. A person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[n 1][7]
    The succession is ordered by male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture. A person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her line) except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. A person's sons and their lines all come before a person's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.[8]
    At the time of accession, the heir to the throne must be a Protestant and enter into communion with the Church of England.[7]
    Anyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is excluded from the line of succession.[7]
Proposed rule changes
Main article: 2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms
At the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the leaders of the Commonwealth realms agreed to introduce legislation to end male primogeniture of descendants of Charles, Prince of Wales, and to allow heirs to the throne to marry Roman Catholics.[9]

Line of succession to the British throne
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the main explanatory article, see Succession to the British throne.
Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714)
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms. The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.[1][2] The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.[3] This article does not attempt to present an exhaustive list, but limits itself to the descendants of the sons of George V. At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all the 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to end male preference primogeniture and the ban on the monarch's marriage to Roman Catholics, and to other changes in the succession rules.[4]
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[5]
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.

Eligibility
The right of succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law,[6] and is limited to the legitimate descendants of legitimate line from the Electress Sophia of Hanover. A person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[n 1][7]
    The succession is ordered by male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture. A person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her line) except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. A person's sons and their lines all come before a person's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.[8]
    At the time of accession, the heir to the throne must be a Protestant and enter into communion with the Church of England.[7]
    Anyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is excluded from the line of succession.[7]
Proposed rule changes
Main article: 2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms
At the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the leaders of the Commonwealth realms agreed to introduce legislation to end male primogeniture of descendants of Charles, Prince of Wales, and to allow heirs to the throne to marry Roman Catholics.[9]

Line of succession to the British throne
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the main explanatory article, see Succession to the British throne.
Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714)
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms. The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.[1][2] The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.[3] This article does not attempt to present an exhaustive list, but limits itself to the descendants of the sons of George V. At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all the 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to end male preference primogeniture and the ban on the monarch's marriage to Roman Catholics, and to other changes in the succession rules.[4]
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[5]
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.

Eligibility
The right of succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law,[6] and is limited to the legitimate descendants of legitimate line from the Electress Sophia of Hanover. A person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[n 1][7]
    The succession is ordered by male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture. A person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her line) except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. A person's sons and their lines all come before a person's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.[8]
    At the time of accession, the heir to the throne must be a Protestant and enter into communion with the Church of England.[7]
    Anyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is excluded from the line of succession.[7]

Line of succession to the British throne
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the main explanatory article, see Succession to the British throne.
Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714)
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms. The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.[1][2] The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.[3] This article does not attempt to present an exhaustive list, but limits itself to the descendants of the sons of George V. At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all the 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to end male preference primogeniture and the ban on the monarch's marriage to Roman Catholics, and to other changes in the succession rules.[4]
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[5]
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.

Eligibility
The right of succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law,[6] and is limited to the legitimate descendants of legitimate line from the Electress Sophia of Hanover. A person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[n 1][7]
    The succession is ordered by male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture. A person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her line) except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. A person's sons and their lines all come before a person's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.[8]
    At the time of accession, the heir to the throne must be a Protestant and enter into communion with the Church of England.[7]
    Anyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is excluded from the line of succession.[7]
Proposed rule changes
Main article: 2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms
At the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the leaders of the Commonwealth realms agreed to introduce legislation to end male primogeniture of descendants of Charles, Prince of Wales, and to allow heirs to the throne to marry Roman Catholics.[9]

Line of succession to the British throne
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the main explanatory article, see Succession to the British throne.
Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714)
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms. The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.[1][2] The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.[3] This article does not attempt to present an exhaustive list, but limits itself to the descendants of the sons of George V. At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all the 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to end male preference primogeniture and the ban on the monarch's marriage to Roman Catholics, and to other changes in the succession rules.[4]
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[5]
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.

Eligibility
The right of succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law,[6] and is limited to the legitimate descendants of legitimate line from the Electress Sophia of Hanover. A person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[n 1][7]
    The succession is ordered by male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture. A person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her line) except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. A person's sons and their lines all come before a person's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.[8]
    At the time of accession, the heir to the throne must be a Protestant and enter into communion with the Church of England.[7]
    Anyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is excluded from the line of succession.[7]
Proposed rule changes
Main article: 2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms
At the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the leaders of the Commonwealth realms agreed to introduce legislation to end male primogeniture of descendants of Charles, Prince of Wales, and to allow heirs to the throne to marry Roman Catholics.[9]

Line of succession to the British throne
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the main explanatory article, see Succession to the British throne.
Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714)
The line of succession to the British throne is the ordered sequence of all those people eligible to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom and the other 15 Commonwealth realms. The Act of Settlement 1701 bestowed succession on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and her descendants while excluding Roman Catholics.[1][2] The British government does not publish an official list of all those in line to succeed, but the work of genealogical authors and amateur researchers suggests that there are several thousand people potentially in line.[3] This article does not attempt to present an exhaustive list, but limits itself to the descendants of the sons of George V. At a summit in Perth, Western Australia in 2011, the heads of government of all the 16 Commonwealth realms agreed to take steps to end male preference primogeniture and the ban on the monarch's marriage to Roman Catholics, and to other changes in the succession rules.[4]
The line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[5]
For earlier versions of the line of succession, see History of the British line of succession.

Eligibility
The right of succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law,[6] and is limited to the legitimate descendants of legitimate line from the Electress Sophia of Hanover. A person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth is not included in the line of succession and passes no rights to their descendants. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[n 1][7]
    The succession is ordered by male-preference (cognatic) primogeniture. A person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her line) except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. A person's sons and their lines all come before a person's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.[8]
    At the time of accession, the heir to the throne must be a Protestant and enter into communion with the Church of England.[7]
    Anyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is excluded from the line of succession.[7]
Proposed rule changes
Main article: 2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms
At the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, the leaders of the Commonwealth realms agreed to introduce legislation to end male primogeniture of descendants of Charles, Prince of Wales, and to allow heirs to the throne to marry Roman Catholics.[9]

The line continues with the descendants of Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood, the only daughter of George V, followed by the other descendants of Edward VII and earlier British monarchs (as well as Frederick, Prince of Wales) back to George I, as the list is limited to Sophia of Hanover's descendants (of whom all presently living are also George I's descendants).
The last person in the line of succession is believed to be Miss Karin Vogel from Rostock, Germany.[3]
